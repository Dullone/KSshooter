A old top-down shooter created with the now discontinued XNA framework.  I created this as a learning project back around 2010.

The git repository itself is missing the /content folder which is required to run the game.

One of my first large projects that used objects and classes to a large extent.  I've learned a lot since then, but this is a good lookback through of my journey of learning.

I also uploaded the accompanying level editor I created to add levels to the game.
