A old top-down shooter created with the now discontinued XNA framework.  I created this as a learning project back around 2010.

The git repository itself is missing the /content folder which is required to run the game.

One of my first large projects that used objects and classes to a large extent.  In the code I can see less than ideal design patterns in some areas - I often violate the one responsiblity pricipal making some of my functions a bit too large.  I've learned a lot since then and the lessons I learned form this project are a big part of that.

I also uploaded the accompanying level editor I created to add levels to the game at:

classes/BinaryHeap.cs and classes/binTree are third party classes and were not created by me.
